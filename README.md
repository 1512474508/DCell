# DeepCell Web
a neural network to interpret cell structure and function

## Introduction
DeepCell Web is an application to provide easy-to-use user interface to the DeepCell neural network for translate cell structure and functions.

Reference implementation is available here:

http://deep-cell.ucsd.edu/

## Documentation

Please visit our [wiki](https://github.com/idekerlab/deep-cell/wiki).


## Developer's Guide
(TBD)

### Note
This application requires GPU-based backend service.  Source code for that service is not public yet.  Once we make it portable, it will be available as an open source project.
